Trigger Code. 
(This Trigger is to assign the Distance field to the Distance Calculation field. So that we can  assign the distance in the sharing rules.) 

Code: 

trigger DropOffTrigger on Drop_Off_point__c (before insert) 
{    
        for(Drop_Off_point__c Drop : Trigger.new)
    { 
        Drop.Distance__c = Drop.distance_calculation__c; 
    } 
}
